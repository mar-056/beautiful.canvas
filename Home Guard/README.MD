# Smart Home Authentication System

## Overview

The Smart Home Authentication System is a secure authentication system designed to provide access control to a smart home environment using fingerprint recognition technology. This system consists of several components:

1. **Fingerprint Recognition Module**: Responsible for capturing and processing fingerprint images.
2. **Database Module**: Manages the storage and retrieval of fingerprint data.
3. **IoT Device Simulator**: Simulates IoT devices sending authentication requests.
4. **Smart Home System**: The central system that verifies authentication requests and controls access to the smart home.

## Components

### 1. Fingerprint Recognition Module

This module includes scripts for capturing and processing fingerprint images. It utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing and feature extraction.

- `finger_print_gen.py`: Generates fingerprint feature descriptors and compares fingerprints for authentication using SIFT algorithm.
- `fingerprint_bitmaps/`: Directory containing sample fingerprint images.

### 2. Database Module

The Database Module manages the storage and retrieval of fingerprint data using PostgreSQL as the backend database.

- `postgresclient.py`: Contains functions to interact with the PostgreSQL database, including storing fingerprint data and retrieving logs.
- `fp_db/`: Directory containing fingerprint image files stored in the database.

### 3. IoT Device Simulator

The IoT Device Simulator script simulates IoT devices sending authentication requests to the Smart Home System.

- `simulateiotdevice.py`: Simulates IoT devices by sending authentication requests with fingerprint data.

### 4. Smart Home System

The Smart Home System verifies authentication requests and controls access to the smart home environment.

- `app.py`: Flask web application that exposes endpoints for authentication and log retrieval.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the Flask application.

## Usage

1. **Setup Database**: Run `postgresclient.py` to create the PostgreSQL database and necessary tables.
2. **Store Fingerprint Data**: Use `postgresclient.py` to store fingerprint data in the database.
3. **Run Smart Home System**: Start the Flask application by running `app.py`.
4. **Simulate IoT Devices**: Execute `simulateiotdevice.py` to simulate IoT devices sending authentication requests.
