## Project Description

This program is designed to run on an ESP32-S2 microcontroller, which acts as a LoRaWAN Gateway with an integrated OLED display. It includes functionalities for handling LoRa communication and displaying important information on the OLED screen. The key features of this project include:

- LoRa Communication: The ESP32-S2 communicates with LoRa devices using LoRaWAN protocols, facilitating long-range and low-power data transmission.

- Wi-Fi Connectivity: The program manages Wi-Fi connectivity, ensuring a stable connection to the specified SSID.

- OLED Display: The integrated OLED display provides real-time information, including Wi-Fi status and received LoRa messages, making it a useful tool for monitoring and debugging.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this project, make sure you have the following components and software installed:

- ESP32-S2 Development Board
- LoRa module (e.g., RYLR993)
- Wi-Fi network credentials (SSID and password)
- Arduino IDE with ESP32-S2 support
- Required Arduino libraries (Adafruit GFX, Adafruit SSD1306, etc.)

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the LoRa module to the ESP32-S2 development board as per your hardware configuration.
2. Ensure that the OLED display is correctly wired to the ESP32-S2, following the pin definitions in the code.

## Software Setup

1. Install the Arduino IDE and add ESP32-S2 support by following the instructions in the [official ESP32-S2 documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html).

2. Install the necessary libraries by navigating to "Sketch" > "Include Library" > "Manage Libraries" in the Arduino IDE. Search for and install the required libraries mentioned in the code comments.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided code to your ESP32-S2 development board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Ensure that the board is connected to your Wi-Fi network.
3. Monitor the OLED display for real-time information, including Wi-Fi status and received LoRa messages.
