               ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub page!

Thrilled to have you here and excited to share with you the projects that I have been working on.


 **  Mental Health App (Java):**
       Mental health is a crucial factor in helping to improve well-being. Our missiong with this project is to create
       a user friendly mental health app that empowers indivudals to take control over their well-being and provides them the tools
       they need to improve their mental health journey. It is inteded to be used in an academic setting, which provides professors 
       anonymous statisitcs on the class's mental health status. This intern will allow professors to make changes that can improve the overall
       mental health of the students in class.

                             Proficient in object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create robust and scalable software solutions.
      ** JavaFx**
                             Experienced in using JavaFx for building modern and interactive user interfaces.

      **MVC Model**
                             Well-versed in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for designing modular and maintainable applications.
      **UML diagrams**
                             Skilled in creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams for visualizing and communicating software designs effectively.
      **Agile/Scrum**
                             Experienced in Agile and Scrum methodologies for efficient project management and collaboration.
      **Git Version Control:**
                             Proficient in using Git for version control, ensuring collaborative development and codebase management.


** ESP32-based IoT LoRa Node + Gateway (C++)**
I am honored to be the recipient of the Reed Garman Award from Bucknell College of Engineering, chosen from among 1000 applicants. My winning proposal centers on the development of an affordable Agricultural IoT solution tailored for regions lacking networking infrastructure. Leveraging LoRa RF technology and a cost-effective satellite backup system, this project empowers farmers with seamless data collection and remote command capabilities via a user-friendly Node-Red dashboard, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.

      **Important Skills**
       **JTAG Debugger**
                         I utilized a JTAG Debugger, specifically the Segger J-Link, to debug the microcontroller unit (MCU) on the custom PCB for the LoRa Node, ensuring its proper functionality and addressing any issues efficiently.

       **PlatformIO**
                         PlatformIO served as a crucial development platform for managing and building the firmware for the ESP32-based LoRa Node and Gateway, streamlining the development process and ensuring code integrity.

       **Free RTOS**
                         By implementing FreeRTOS, I enhanced the real-time capabilities of the system, enabling efficient multitasking and resource management within the firmware of the ESP32-based LoRa Gateway.
       
       **C++**
                       I developed and optimized the firmware for the ESP32-based LoRa Gateway and Node using C++, which not only reduced the system's power consumption by 40% but also improved the overall system performance.

       **ESP32**
                        The ESP32 microcontroller was the heart of this project, and I extensively utilized its capabilities to develop the firmware and manage communication between the LoRa Node and Gateway.

       **Node Red**
                     I created a Node-Red implementation on AWS, which allowed for duplex communication, enabling the receipt of sensor data and remote control of irrigation relays through Wi-Fi and satellite links, making data analysis and control accessible to users.
       
       **PCB KiCad**
                     I designed a custom PCB for the LoRa Node, ensuring that it met the project's specific requirements and functionality, and I used KiCad as the design tool.

       **Lora**
                     Leveraging LoRa RF technology, I established long-range and low-power communication between the LoRa Node and Gateway, enabling efficient data transmission for agricultural applications.

       **Iridium SATCOM**
                      I implemented a satellite backup system for the LoRa Gateway using Iridium SATCOM, ensuring data communication even in remote areas with no networking infrastructure.

       **AT Commands + UART**
                       I integrated the Iridium SATCOM module into the system using UART communication and AT commands, allowing for seamless satellite communication as part of the backup system.
