In this personal project, the focus was on creating a LoRa GPS tracker using an ESP32 microcontroller and implementing FreeRTOS for efficient multitasking. The C++ code developed for the ESP32 was responsible for reading GPS data and transmitting it via a LoRa module using UART communication. On the receiving end, a location viewer was established using Python and the Flask web framework. This viewer processed the incoming data and presented it through a user-friendly web interface. To visualize the GPS data effectively, the project incorporated the Google Maps API, allowing real-time tracking of the LoRa GPS Beacon's location. The use of Git for version control and Visual Studio Code for code development ensured a systematic approach to managing and advancing the project. This undertaking showcases the integration of embedded systems, wireless communication, web development, and mapping APIs in a single, cohesive project.
