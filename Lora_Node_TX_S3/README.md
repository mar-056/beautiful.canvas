## Project Description

This program is designed to run on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, functioning as a LoRaWAN Node. It sends a test message over LoRa communication to a specified address. The key features of this project include:

- LoRa Communication: The ESP32-S3 communicates using LoRaWAN protocols to send messages to other LoRa devices or gateways.

- UART Bridge: It establishes a bridge between the Serial and Serial1 interfaces for data forwarding.

- Configuration: The program configures the LoRa module's address and sends test messages periodically.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this project, make sure you have the following components and software installed:

- ESP32-S3 Development Board
- LoRa module (e.g., RYLR993)
- Arduino IDE with ESP32-S3 support
- Required Arduino libraries (if any)

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the LoRa module to the ESP32-S3 development board as per your hardware configuration.

## Software Setup

1. Install the Arduino IDE and add ESP32-S3 support by following the instructions in the [official ESP32-S3 documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html).

2. If required, install any necessary libraries through the Arduino IDE's library manager.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided code to your ESP32-S3 development board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Ensure that the hardware connections are set up correctly.
3. The ESP32-S3 will send test messages over LoRa communication to the specified address.
